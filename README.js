// Breakdown of work:

// Date - March 20
// # tanish Bansal
// I worked on Delete function:
// I first reviewed the code to look at the structure of the code and how the naming conventions were used.
// i  then looked at the delete buon in the single-reminder.ejs file to see how the delete function would be implemented
// then i got the id of the reminder.
// looked at stackoverflow to see how to implement the delete function.
//found a way to filter the reminders in the databse to delete the reminder.
// did some testing to see how filter function works.
// I then created the delete function in the reminder_controller.js file.
// I then tested the delete function by running the server and checking if the delete function was working.

// # Richard Yuan
// I worked on the Update function:
// I first reviewed the code to look at the structure of the code and how the naming conventions were used.
// I then looked at the edit button in the single-reminder.ejs file to see how the update function would be implemented
// I then got the id of the reminder.
// I then created the update function in the reminder_controller.js file.
// I then tested the update function by running the server and checking if the update function was working.
// But found that the update function was not working as expected.
// only went from false to true and not the other way around.
// I then fixed the update function by changing the if statement to check if the value was true or false.
// the code was then tested again to see if the update function was working as expected.
// it worked as expected and the update function was working as expected.

// # Ashutosh
// Configured passport.js file:
// I first reviewed the code to look at the structure of the code and how the naming conventions were used.
// added a local strategy to the passport.js file.
// I then created a function to serialize the user.
// I then created a function to deserialize the user.
// I then created a function to check if the user is authenticated.
// I then created a function to check if the user is authorized.
// used usermodel to check if the user exists in the database.'
// usercontroller was then used to check if the user exists in the database.
// I then tested the passport.js file by running the server and checking if the passport.js file was working.
// Did not work as expected.
// usermodel works but the passport.js file was not working as expected.
//  Still working on the passport.js file to see if the issue can be resolved.
